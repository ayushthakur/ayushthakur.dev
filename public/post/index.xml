      <description>After watching this video by Veritasium. I realized that geometry was the origin of all of algebra, at least a lot of advancements to it. For eg: Let&amp;rsquo;s take a simple Quadratic Equation x^2 + x = 20, anyone can apply the quadratic formula to solve it but before that, it was Geometry that solved such problems ( I highly recommend you to watch the video to understand how it was done, my notes below might not help you imagine it as clearly as was done in the video)</description>

      <description>I was listening to this great episode on 99% invisible (one of the best podcasts I listen to). The idea was - How do you communicate with someone 10k years in future to convey them the message that a certain box contains radioactive material and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be touched (as it is an existential risk)
This was an actual project in the US and they hired a bunch fo artists, communicators etc.</description>

      <description>I was reading this brillant piece on career by Nikhyl Singhal. Apart from the main argument of &amp;lsquo;stage of the company&amp;rsquo; that Nykhil makes. I want to expand on the thought of &amp;rsquo;longetivity of tech career&amp;rsquo; more.
As the article mentoins, with the improvement in health, most of us would work way past our 60 and may be till our 90s, taking a safer side, let&amp;rsquo;s reduce it by 20% and keep it at 72.</description>

      <description>The idea of the blog is to continue my writing journey but now (in public). The initial aim is to publish more and publish often (quantity &amp;raquo; quality) to build momentum. The rest will be figured out later.</description>

      <description>I started my career in Bangalore back in February 2015, within a year I realized that most of Bangalore thinks that I am mistaken, as I lived in Whitefield.

Adventures Link to heading 1. Try indoor bouldering / climbing I went to equilibium gym in Indiranagar. They charge Rs.</description>
