<p><strong>1. Try indoor bouldering / climbing</strong>
I went to <a href="https://equilibriumclimbing.com/">equilibium gym</a> in Indiranagar. They charge Rs. 500 for a day pass. You can climb for as long as you want. Keep shorts, sportswear, they have lockers facility.</p>
<p><strong>2. Cuboon Park</strong></p>
<p>You can go here for a leisurely walk in the morning hours.</p>
<p><em>Cubbon Park State Library</em>: The library is beautiful inside out. The best thing is that you can take your own laptop / books and sit there and study for as long as you want. Just ensure that you don&rsquo;t click pictures and keep your mobile on silent mode.</p>
<p>On Sundays and certain (2nd and 4th Saturday) you can bring your skates or skateboards and learn or practice at along with many members of the Bengaluru Skaters. Checkout their instagram to know more</p>

<li><a href="https://www.zomato.com/bangalore/sharon-tea-stall-thippasandra">Sheron Tea Stall</a> My favourite tea stall in this world. A must try. You can club this with Burger Seigneur. Their biscuits are damn nice (this is coming from someone who doesnt&rsquo; eat biscuits)</li>
<li>IDC Kitchen: Really good Dosa, with non-sweet Sambaar.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.zomato.com/bangalore/kunafa-story-koramangala-5th-block-bangalore">Kunafa Story</a> This has become my favourite dessert place. I do not have a sweet tooth, until I find myself near 5th block Kormangala. I would suggest dining in over ordering in. Say hi to Tanzil from my side.</li>
