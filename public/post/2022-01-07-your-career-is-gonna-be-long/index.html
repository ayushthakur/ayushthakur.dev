    <p>I was reading this brillant <a href="https://theskip.substack.com/p/stage-of-company-not-name-of-company">piece</a> on career by Nikhyl Singhal. Apart from the main argument of &lsquo;stage of the company&rsquo; that Nykhil makes. I want to expand on the thought of &rsquo;longetivity of tech career&rsquo; more.</p>
<p>As the article mentoins, with the improvement in health, most of us would work way past our 60 and may be till our 90s, taking a safer side, let&rsquo;s reduce it by 20% and keep it at 72.</p>
<p>If I take my case, I am 28 right now and have 6 years of work experience. I still have 22 more years to reach 50 and then 22 more years to reach 72. That means, out of (22+22+6) 50 years of total work experience, I spent 6 right now.
i.e. if my career is an ODI match innings then I have not even played the first power play.</p>
<p>Now, when I think about the decisions to make in my career, this is a good perspective to keep.</p>
<p>Also, just want to expand on the factors that we consider while making a job shift.</p>
<ul>
<li>compensation</li>
<li>brand (name of the company)</li>
<li>peers / potential</li>
<li>potential impact / value</li>
<li>work-life balance</li>
<li>work-culture</li>
<li>learning</li>
<li>Stage of the company (after you read the mentoined article)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think, &lsquo;compensation&rsquo; is a strong factor that people consider (at least it has been a pivotal one in my ciricle).
But focusing only on compensation is like focussing only on &rsquo;number of runs in this over&rsquo; in the ODI innings analogy, that isn&rsquo;t the right approach for a long innings.</p>
