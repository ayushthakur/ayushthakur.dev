      <description>After watching this video by Veritasium. I realized that geometry was the origin of all of algebra, at least a lot of advancements to it. For eg: Let&amp;rsquo;s take a simple Quadratic Equation x^2 + x = 20, anyone can apply the quadratic formula to solve it but before that, it was Geometry that solved such problems ( I highly recommend you to watch the video to understand how it was done, my notes below might not help you imagine it as clearly as was done in the video)</description>

      <description>I was listening to this great episode on 99% invisible (one of the best podcasts I listen to). The idea was - How do you communicate with someone 10k years in future to convey them the message that a certain box contains radioactive material and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be touched (as it is an existential risk)
This was an actual project in the US and they hired a bunch fo artists, communicators etc.</description>
