## January

## February


## March
- started my fitness journey more religiously (after recovering from bad viral fever last month)
- played Holi in society and realized that holi is the perfect festival to see the real nature of an otherwise polished immigrant population.
- setup a stall in the society flea market where we tried selling wife's digital art & some masala coke. Artists must prepare for a hard day when they sell their products to general population. Most people don't value art.
- attended multiple flea markets (soul sante & others) and also spent a lot in clothes shopping.
- started climbing. I think we will pick this sport as weekly adventure.
- got a good barber on Urban Clap, haircut issues sorted now.
- tried a reels challenge with wife & caused her a sprain. now we just stick to sharing couple challenges reels
- travelled to Goa with wife (her first goa trip). More details on Goa Diaries blog.
- marchtee sale was one, so spent way more than I had to
- started taking more random pictures to ensure I create more memories
- 

## April
- started with a trip to Mumbai to meet wife's college friends
- climbed a rope on a tree with local kids, they were fascinated with my abs
- watched the moonset at the marine drive, with wife and thousand other people (because Mumbai)
- have been struggling with sleep for the past 20 days or so
- visited jaipur for a friend's wedding, I realized that I really struggle with food in Rajasthan. I am not a fan of the cuisine (probably it is the lack of egg availability)
- visited my niece in Pune. Don't be afraid of talking technical things with kids, they might enjoy it.
- If you are in Pune, you should order Alphonso from Malpani Mangoes atleast once (it's quite good)
- went to write club bangalore again, I must go there often. Good fiction writing is a difficult and rewarding skill to have
- attended India's first skating disco. It was great for photos and videos but overall, not as fun as it looked on camera
- took two besties out for dinner, realized we should do it more often. Atleast once every quarter
- travelled to Nepal for brother-in-law's wedding

## May

- stuti's family visited. Stuti and I had many fights, but most were resolved.
