Everyone has an internal voice that keeps talking to them. It acts as a constant companion which gives us advice as well as feedback.
This is the most constant feedback mechanism that we have & it probably impacts us more than we know. 

Now, unlike other voices in our lives, such as those of friends, family, and colleagues, this internal voice is never heard by anyone else, so you cannot validate if its tone is fair or not. A good way to understand yourself is to identify the tone of this voice. During discussions on this topic, I have found that most people agree that the tone of this voice changes based on the situation or context. For example, when you choose not to do the right thing, the voice may scold you in a harsh tone. However, when you put in effort and still don't get the desired result, it may be kinder to you. But this isn't always the case. I have personally gone through phases where my internal voice had a very judgmental tone, regardless of the context. For example, if I made a small mistake, such as sending a half-written email, the judgmental voice would make me feel bad about the mistake. However, as the voice changed and became more understanding, it helped me develop strategies to avoid such mistakes in the future (e.g. insert the "to:" section with email addresses only after composing the entire email).

I have noticed that this voice has changed for me every three to four years. The voice wasn't very helpful when I was in my teens, the voice kept making me feel like a victim because of a major traumatic incidence that happened to me. That translated into me believing that I was unlucky & I deserve luck. This eventually translated into rebeling with violent acts whenever I saw things not working in my favor. Now the voice is very supportive, encouraging, uplifting. I do not know of any other way but having a supportive, encouraging voice.
