## January

## February


## March
- started my fitness journey more religiously (after recovering from bad viral fever last month)
- played Holi in society and realized that holi is the perfect festival to see the real nature of an otherwise polished immigrant population.
- setup a stall in the society flea market where we tried selling wife's digital art & some masala coke. Artists must prepare for a hard day when they sell their products to general population. Most people don't value art.
- attended multiple flea markets (soul sante & others) and also spent a lot in clothes shopping.
- started climbing. I think we will pick this sport as weekly adventure.
- got a good barber on Urban Clap, haircut issues sorted now.
- tried a reels challenge with wife & caused her a sprain. now we just stick to sharing couple challenges reels
- travelled to Goa with wife (her first goa trip). More details on Goa Diaries blog.
- marchtee sale was one, so got my yearly supply of basics.
- started taking more random pictures to ensure I create more memories
