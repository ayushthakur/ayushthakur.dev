Do you remember what you had last monday for lunch? Most probaly not, because it was a routine monday. 

But do you remember what you had for lunch on the day when you took a leave from office for no reason and went out for a movie with your friend? High chance that you do. 

The reason is that it was a weird day. Weird means that it was something outside your routine. 

Routine smoothes out the passage of time and when you look back most days don't have anything different to offer. So the memory of those days merges and you don't remember much.

But if you introduce a little variance in your routine, a few moments of madness with the sole aim of doing something which is out of the ordinary (which will more often than not be outside your comfort zone). Then your perception of time will be skewed and you will remember these moments.
So go ahead introduce variance.

- wake up one fine tuesday and take a leave randomly and go out and visit the nearby market, if you usually take car, go by a bus one day. Try a completely new cuisine, visit a friend during their office hours or surpirse yourself with a gourmet dinner post work.
