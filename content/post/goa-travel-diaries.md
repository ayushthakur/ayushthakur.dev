*Note: This post will be updated with every Goa trip that I do. For now I have just updated 1/6 of my trips. 
Documenting old trips will require some google photos digging, so it will happen later in the year.*

# March 2023

### Travelled with wife. This was her first time in Goa and she loved it
- We were in water for as long as was possible, absolutely loved it. Small Vagator and Morjim were our favorite beaches to take a dip(in this trip)

###    Restaurant / Cafe Recommendations (in North Goa)
- Burger Factory (Anjuna/Morjim)
- La Plage (Ashwem)
- Baba Au Rhum (Anjuna)
- Artjuna (I am not really a fan of the food here, but drinks & ambiance are great) - (Anjuna)
- Cafe Continga (Anjuna) - this cafe is open till 4am, a perfect place for night cravings. I had chicken curry with rice here. I loved the taste, the onion & chilli salad was such a nice add on.
- Bean me up (Vagator) - We loved this vegan restaurant. The food, setting and the service were all top notch. I specially loved their drinks, very refreshing. We were sad that we went there for our last meal of the trip & had to rush to catch the flight.

###    Late night
- Dubki Club (Vagator) - dance party (they were open till 3:30am)
- Hilltop Flea Market (Friday) (Vagator) - Lots of jewellery and clothes collection. Good live music and fun crowd.

###    Accomodation
- Alcove Beach Resort (small vagator): We really liked the stay here. We got a beach view stay and absolutely loved the beach. Hospitality is one of those industries where experienced staff makes a difference.

### Casino
- We went to a casino (Big Daddy) and were severely disappointed with the crowd, food and overall value for money.
