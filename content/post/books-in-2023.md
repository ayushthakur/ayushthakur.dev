One of my goal for 2023 was to read more books. I am an average reader at best (as per my old kindle & [pocket](https://getpocket.com/) stats).

This year I was carrying my kindle wherever possible and also consciously nudging myself to read more books using streaks app on iOS.

Anyway, here is a list of all the titles that I have read this year.

- learnings: 

- The first half the year was good in terms of number of titles read. Then in the second half things slowed down a little more. I kept starting multiple titles and leaving them after 30-40%. 
- A constant flow of good fiction books can help reduce the hurdles that comes with non-fiction.
- I ended up choosing many books that were short, you end up gaming the metrics that you are optimizing for. Many books which I only finished 30% were longer than actual books that I finished 100%
- Reels and access to phone is a big detriment to everything and especially a good reading session.
