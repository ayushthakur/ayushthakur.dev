One of my goal for 2023 is to read more books. I am an average reader at best (as per my old kindle & [pocket](https://getpocket.com/) stats).

This year I am carrying my kindle wherever possible and also consciously nudging myself to read more books using streaks app on iOS.

Anyway, here is a list of all the titles that I have read this year or I am currently reading.
I will eventually create a separate page of all book recommendations & a link to my goodreads profile.
Till then [here is my partially updated goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25285537-ayush-thakur)

- Updates: 

*July: progress is a little stalled now. I have picked up too many books and lost context on many of these. I will be better next month*

*August: Got distracted by some good old articles, so spent a good enough time reading but no progress in books*

*September: Things are going good. Maintaining good pace*
