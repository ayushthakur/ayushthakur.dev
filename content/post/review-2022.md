I am a little late to post this, to be precise, I am 32 days late, but screw it, let's do it.

Bullets in no particular order:

- started the year by contracting covid, this was my first time. 
    - a small win is that I didn't infect anyone else in the family, as I was super cautious       
    - lost 4 kgs and some strength as well, but eventually gained the strength back
- remember I mentioned that I settled on one person last year, well I got engaged to her in March
    - we celebrated it as a Holi event, full of colors
- I diagnosed myself with multiple diseases by googling about symptoms
    - don't google your way into anxiety, you are better than this. Also, you will die anyway
- tried wall climbing, and enjoyed it
- tried rifle shooting, and had much fun
- tried my hands on making reels / short-form video, the obsession lasted a week or two, but made satisfactory progress
- tried very expensive Alphonso mangoes, and loved it.
- took fitness more seriously
    - enrolled with a coach
    - followed the diet to the T
    - focussed on hypertrophy
    - enjoyed the results, and will continue next year as well
- wrote many beautiful letters, some to myself, some to others
    - write more, there are no downsides to it
- played lots of basketball
    - choose a sport, obsess over it
- travelled to Malaysia for work
    - got a covid scare
    - ate lots of food
    - nothing beats Penang in street food
- got a typewriter as a gift from my fiance, loved it
    - wrote to many people
- bought clothes, too many clothes
- got covid again middle of the year
- went on many dates, luckily with the same person :P
    - one included painting together on a hilltop near a waterfall (her idea)   
- read a lot of variety, some random pointers that I remember the top of the mind
    - you can talk to yourself with a kind voice, it changes your relationship with yourself
    - the world is run by people who care for nothing but power, psychopaths are a minority only in numbers not in impact
    - a good building is always changing as per the demands of its occupants, a bad one stays the same but only for a few years then it crumbles
    - reading books in your native / mother tongue is important to keep yourself connected with your younger self. Many emotions don't translate to another language
    - america has too much influence on what we tend to like, soft power is magic
- danced a lot
- ate lots of apple pies
- spent a lot of time with my niece Arya, and loved every single second of it
    - spend time with kids, they truly change the way you see the world
- traveled quite a bit
    - went on a road trip, saw a snake
    - traveled solo to mountains
    - talked to strangers and made some new friends
    - ate really good food
    - traveled on the "chaiyyan chaiyyan" steam train and enjoyed every bit of it
    - stayed in a 108-year-old house with a fireplace on, lights went out at night and the doors kept screeching. Could have easily gotten scared of a potential ghost, but was more scared of an uninvited human being.
- learned CPR, wow, it can save lives
- watched Messi lift the world cup, and almost cried
    - sports are beautiful because of the stories of the players, rest it is bullshit corrupt business dealings
- got married (to the person i got engaged with in march :P)
    - missed my father a lot
    - live-tweeted the whole wedding
    - played basketball right after the wedding ceremony
- went to delhi for a friend's wedding
    - saw someone jacking off on the street (for him it was his home)
    - ate lots of food: realized most legendary places do not serve quality food, it doesn't even taste good. It's just the brand name, that brings in the confirmation bias at play and we keep praising it
    - some people dream to be where you are
