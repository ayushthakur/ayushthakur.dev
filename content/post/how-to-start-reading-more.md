I envy those who started reading books when they were in class 4. I was too busy trying to be the fastes bowler in my street and books didn't really attract me much. The only books that I picked up were the course books and that too only during the exam times.

But I developed a habit of reading in the later years of my adolscence. While I still read at a very average throughput, it is quite better than where I started.

So you want to read more. 
Start with things that you like, it could be anything that interests you - urges, cricket, kardashians, religion, cars, veganism, climate, trump.
Find books that interests you, not the ones that you would like to finish and share with the world but those that would keep you away from instagram.

Create a feed of interests using feedly or flipboard.
Save whatever articles you like on pocket or instapaper. (I like pocket, I donn't know why anyone would use instapaper)

Save your articles and then read them as you go.
