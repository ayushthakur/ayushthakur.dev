- Hi, I am Ayush. I am a data scientist by profession.
- I love basketball, diaries & handmade papers.
- I love reading. I have been collating articles for close to 4 years:
    - [readingdiet blog (solo)](https://readingdiet.wordpress.com/)
    - [25 ftw newsletter (collab) - 74 issues](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/25ftw) - a weekly newsletter with a new theme each week 
    
    PS: the above link isn't working anymore because Twitter decided to shutdown revue (the blog platform) within a year of acquiring them. If you want that collection of articles you can mail me on the email address shared below.
    - Weekly Reads Blog - for a design studio (paid gig)
